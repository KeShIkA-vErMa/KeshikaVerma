      <h1>The Art of Unlearning: How Fear and Uncertainty Can Unlock Your Creativity</h1>
      
      <p><strong>By: Keshika Verma</strong></p>
      
      <p>Good morning everyone, I am Keshika Verma. I'm 15 years old, and it's been apparently two years since I’ve been a teenager. I'd say I've been through a myriad of experiences, which have given rise to a number of feelings and emotions. And I must agree, there was this one feeling, ladies and gentlemen, which was so strong, so intense, that I almost took the worst decisions you can think of in a teenage student’s life.</p>
      
      <p>The emotion I’m talking about is <strong>fear</strong>… and… <strong>anxiety</strong> about what the future holds for me.</p>

      <p>Talking about fear of failure and uncertainty—we’ve all been taught to avoid those, haven’t we? We’ve been conditioned to believe that uncertainty is dangerous. That not knowing what’s going to happen is something we should be afraid of.</p>

      <p>Let me share something I’ve come to believe deeply. The topic of this TED-style talk is close to my heart, and it’s about unlearning the belief that fear is always negative or crippling. I want you to recognize that fear can be a <strong>force for good</strong>.</p>

      <h2>My Turning Point</h2>

      <p>Let me take you back to my 10th-grade year. Growing up in India, the board exams are seen as a massive hurdle—especially if you’re studying under the ICSE board.</p>

      <p>It was the start of the academic year and I had already set my goal: score above 95%. I started preparing diligently, day and night.</p>

      <p>But then fear crept in. The fear that no matter how hard I worked, I might still fail. It started small—just a little self-doubt—but over time, it grew bigger than me. By mid-year, I was consumed by fear. And then I did the unthinkable: I stopped studying.</p>

      <p>From being the academic topper since 2nd grade, I was now too afraid to even try. I was terrified that I would give my all… and still not succeed. That’s what fear does—it cripples you, if you let it.</p>

      <p>But something shifted in October. We went for counseling, and my counselor told me: <strong>"Fear of failure is natural, Keshika, but it can either be the thing that breaks you or the thing that makes you unstoppable."</strong></p>

      <p>She gave an example I’ll never forget: Fear of death doesn’t stop death—it’s inevitable. But fear of death gives you a choice: to either stop living, or to start living more fully. That was my lightbulb moment.</p>

      <p>That day, I <em>unlearned</em> that fear was a weakness. And from that day forward, fear became my <strong>fuel</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Challenge to You</h2>

      <p>So today, I want to challenge you: <strong>unlearn the belief</strong> that fear is always bad.</p>

      <p>When you stop seeing fear as an enemy, and start seeing it as your greatest motivator, everything changes. Fear of failure is not the weight that holds you down—it’s the fire that lifts you up.</p>

      <p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
