                    friend,' then MIT Scratch, to now when I code professionally using Java Programming Language and
                    HTML. I trusted the process. With so much to remember and share with my connections, I've divided
                    the description of my school journey into three posts. The first one is about the leadership
                    positions I have held, the second about my academics and third about my extracurriculars. This is
                    Post 2.
                    I can’t remember the grades I used to get when I was a child, but I remember being a chatterbox…!
                    I was the academic topper of English, Computer Applications, Biology and Physics in grade 9, with a
                    cumulative percentage of 96.5% ICSE. I won the heritage exhibition and a laptop in the Byjus’ Win a
                    laptop challenge.
                    <br>
                    In grade 10, I got slightly diseased. But, once again, with the guidance and support of the family,
                    my brother, Alankrit Verma, my mother, Shalini Verma, and my father, Vivek Verma, I did not give up,
                    in fact, I decided to do more than I had been doing.
                    I won almost all the quizzes, Science Quest, English Quest, Computer Quest, Social Studies Quest and
                    many more. I showcased my crafting excellence by winning the Science Exhibition and Heritage
                    Exhibition. I found myself to be inclined towards one Language only (English), so, to make progress
                    in the Hindi Language, I won the Hindi Story Writing and the Hindi Essay Writing competitions. I
                    even won the GLOBAL Heartfulness Essay Event and was honoured with a Certificate of Merit (Topic -
                    "The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the Earth"). I also organsied a cultural fiesta for
                    1950+ people.
                    <br>
                    I have topped subjects including Physics and Mathematics, but I am very passionate about the English
                    Language and Computer Science. This blend of interests in Computer Science and English has not only
                    shaped my academic pursuits but also my future aspirations. It has instilled in me a unique
                    perspective, balancing technical acumen with creative expression, poised to make a meaningful impact
                    in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.
                    I am skilled in Java Programming Language, HTML, and am learning more and more. I have also created
                    a project (working model) based on Light Fidelity in Grade 9 and working model that depicted climate
                    change and its adverse impacts in grade 10.

                    practising for a month just in order to win a dance competition at school, which I now find of
                    little significance. Memories of Dance Competitions, singing competitions, fancy dress competitions,
                    Declamation Competitions and thousand other things are stretched in my mind for time immemorial.
                    <br>
                    With so much to remember and share with my connections, I've divided the description of my school
                    journey into three posts. The first one is about the leadership positions I have held, the second of
                    my academics and third about my extracurriculars. This is Post 3.
                    <br>
                    In class 5, I remember winning myself 5 gold medals and 2 silver medals in English declamation,
                    Hindi declamation, dance, singing, story writing, and whatnot!, along with rank 3 in the class. I
                    was not less than an all rounder and it got even better in grade 6!
                    <br>
                    In grade 7 and 8, the lock down hit. But...that did not stop me. I kept working hard.
                    <br>
                    In grade 8, I got my first significant out of school achievement, which blew my mind and my family's
                    mind! 3rd in North India was a big deal! How? - I participated in the ASISC Father Hess Memorial
                    Literary events (grade 8) for the Declamation Category and won myself a gold medal at the state
                    level, receiving a golden opportunity to represent my state (Himachal Pradesh) in the northern
                    region of India. I won third rank in North India.
                    <br>
                    I did the same in grade 9, with first rank in the state and went to St. Stephen's School Chandigarh
                    for the Regional competition. I got to interact with so many people having similar interests and
                    future plans, which was a lot of fun. In grade 10, I won the silver medal at state level and I found
                    myself to be lucky to interact and share thoughts with the people at Sacred Heart Sr. Sec. School,
                    Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh.
                    <br>
                    Because of the unwavering guidance and support I received from my bro Alankrit Verma, I started
                    participating in more competitions.
                    I was a part of the school's girls' football team in grade 9. I have a proven track record in
                    English, winning all the Competitions, and winning a laptop in the Byjus' Win a Laptop challenge!! I
                    love making rangoli and coordinated a team to make a rangoli based on space research on Children's
                    day!
                    <br>
                    I even brought out the actor in me. I participated in the English skit, which presented the Merchant
                    of Venice play by Sir. William Shakespeare; I got the role of the main character, Portia, because of
                    my eloquence in English and unexpected talent in acting. I organised a cultural fiesta for a
                    gathering of 1950+ people. I even won the title of 'Miss OLS' in the farewell function. For my
                    Eloquence, Leadership Skills and Wisdom, I was titled 'Miss Future President' by my juniors at
                    school.
                    <br> <br>
                    Lastly, of course, I believe - “If you can speak, you can influence. If you can influence, you can
                    change lives”.

                    ended a chapter of my life and am about to start another. Last night, I lay on my bed, awake and
                    wide eyed. I decided to write this post when I found myself crying.
                    <br>
                    I have always been very ambitious. The first fruit I got for my dedication in the form a leadership
                    position in the school Cabinet was Class Monitor in grade 5 🚀. Now I find it insignificant but it
                    was a great deal that time. My parents thought that I brought unimaginable pride to the family. I
                    loved that!. That motivated me to such an extent that I won myself 5 gold medals and 2 silver medals
                    that year in English declamation, Hindi declamation, dance, singing, story writing, and whatnot!,
                    along with rank 3 in the class. In grade 6, things improved even more!
                    <br>
                    In grade 7 and 8, the lock down hit. But...that did not stop me. I worked hard.
                    I was the Secretary of English Literary Club in grade 8, the Deputy Head Girl of the School in grade
                    9 and finally the Head Girl in Grade 10! I organised a number of events, led a great team of people
                    to carry the legacy of one of the best schools in the state forward. It has definitely prepared me
                    for leadership roles in the future! Thanks a lot to my bro Alankrit Verma, for all the guidance he
                    has given to me.
                    <br>
                    I hosted a number of events, of which a Cultural Fiesta for 1950+ people stands out. I got to
                    interact with my city's IAS, IPS, and IFS officers and earned a lot of recognition. I am fond of my
                    heritage and culture and was interviewed by the media on the day of the Heritage Exhibition of my
                    school in Kullu. I am a volunteer at the Red Cross Society and am dedicated to community service.
                    <br>
                    I sometimes try to recall my past great experiences, which overwhelm me and bring tears of gratitude
                    for the journey I am on.

                    <br>
                    “The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
                    But I have promises to keep,
                    And miles to go before I sleep,
                    And miles to go before I sleep.”
                    <br>
                    These lines from my favourite poem - “Stopping by the woods on a Snowy Evening” by Robert Frost,
                    encourage me to persevere and remain dedicated to my responsibilities, knowing that there is still
                    much more to accomplish on this path of leadership and progress.!
