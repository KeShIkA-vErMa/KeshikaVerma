      <h1>She Was Talking To Me</h1>
      <p>There are journeys that begin with a road, or a plan, or a decision. And then, there is this journey. My journey with this book began with a thought. And with time, this book changed how I saw the world. As a child, I liked to write about princesses and their maids, until a dinner-table conversation with my father changed things.</p>

      <p>For context, I live in Himachal. It’s… a quiet place, in the Himalayan mountain ranges. It was 2021. I was in 8th standard. The country was under lockdown because of the pandemic when my teacher gave us an assignment: “Write a speech. Any topic.”</p>

      <p>In those days, it was hard not to think about technology. AI, algorithms, robots, everyone was talking about them. I didn’t understand much, but I was curious. My father and I talked about artificial intelligence. He mentioned how robots could be smarter than humans, which was seemingly disturbing to him because we wouldn’t want something that we created ourselves to grow stronger than us.</p>

      <p>And the journey had only just begun. It stayed in my mind longer than I expected. The thoughts kept on evolving, more and more. I didn’t leave princesses overnight. But one by one, the crowns faded. The castles crumbled. And oh I found myself scribbling about power, control, and the world as it could be… not as I once imagined it!</p>

      <p>Little did I know, this quiet shift would lead to bigger revelations… the kind that wouldn’t fit in fairytales. But in the end, I didn’t speak about AI at all. I talked about something completely different in the speech, about war and peace, about India and its standing. I gave my speech. The class clapped. The tab closed. And like so many things, the conversation faded.</p>

      <p>Yet, that initial thought kept coming back. I went online to learn more about AI. I scribbled on weekends, writing things that amazed me. Then came a quiet night. My midterm exams were over. I had nothing urgent to do, no revision, no tests. Just silence, and a notebook. I sat down at my study table and started scribbling.</p>

      <p>Robots attacking Kullu, my home. I, the protagonist, attacked them back to save the people of my town, but my energy was draining. I needed backup. I imagined it vividly. Smoke in the air. The hills lit with red flashes. My school, crushed. My neighbours, running. My mother, screaming my name, calling me. My father, trying to rescue animals from the local shelter, as always.</p>

      <p>I was looking for help. And then I wrote something like: “Reinforcements came to save me and the remaining few, from Delhi, the country's capital.” I paused. The arrival of the reinforcements should sound like a moment of hope to all. But instead, it felt… wrong. I asked myself as I wrote that down, why would people from Delhi come all the way to Kullu? Would they even know what was happening? Would they even care?</p>

      <p>That’s when a question formed, quiet, sharp, and somehow more real than anything I’d written so far: Why do I assume people would come to save us? Why do I assume people feel connected at all? Would they come for headlines? For guilt? Out of principle? Out of love? Or not come at all?</p>

      <p>Do we even have shared humanity? What makes someone run into danger for someone else? I stared at the notebook, still open, and I felt it. I wasn’t just writing a robot story anymore. I was writing about something deeper. About abandonment. About connection. About the invisible thread we claim ties people together, and whether that thread even exists.</p>

      <p>The story was still about robots. But I had started asking a new kind of question. And I knew the old version of the book wouldn’t survive this. Because now the story wasn’t just about what happens. It was about why people act, and why they don’t.</p>

      <p>That idea, in some quiet way, changed me and I wanted to continue on this journey. At first, I thought I was just imagining things. The divisions, the disconnection, the breakdown of trust. I had written them into the story as a possibility. A warning. Not as something real.</p>

      <p>But then I looked around. The world wasn’t as united as we liked to pretend. Nations that shared trade deals couldn’t share vaccines. Alliances collapsed over politics. Empathy turned into strategy. The idea that humans could forget their own humanity, it wasn’t fiction anymore.</p>

      <p>I watched countries wage wars, not just with weapons, but with narratives. And the story I had created began to feel less like science fiction, and more like a quiet truth no one wanted to say out loud.</p>

      <p>The book had made me imagine a fractured world. But the world was already cracking. It was strange. I had written the story. But now it felt like the world was writing back.</p>

      <p>The journey began in my mind. Before the book, I thought stories had to be fast and dramatic. But writing that book made me slow down and question things. I listened differently, to conversations, to textbooks. I stopped accepting easy answers. That was the first shift: from certainty to curiosity.</p>

      <p>The book also changed how I spoke. I used to answer fast. Now I ask more. When something felt wrong in class, I didn’t stay silent. It was the journey inward. Long hours, tired hands, eyes that couldn’t switch off. I didn’t just write a book. I walked through one. And I came out changed.</p>

      <p>By the time I reached 11th grade, the book was no longer just a hobby. It wasn’t something I was writing to impress anyone. And it wasn’t something I was just writing for myself anymore either. Something had changed, again.</p>

      <p>Now, when I sat down to write, I wasn’t thinking about plot twists. I was thinking about people. About readers. About what they might feel when they read a sentence. About what kind of questions I could leave behind in their minds, just like the book had left in mine.</p>

      <p>I had walked through a journey with this book. Now I wanted others to walk through it too. That was the next step: from writing to reflect, to writing to ripple.</p>

      <p>The most inspirational character in the book is Liora. Liora, a character from another planet. She isn’t there to attack or to rescue. She’s there to ask one thing: “Why do you always forget that you are one species?”</p>

      <p>She wasn’t just speaking to the characters. She was speaking to me. To all of us. Because the story, I realised, wasn’t about machines at the end. It was about what we do to each other. About how quickly we forget compassion. About how ideals get replaced by survival, and how division wins when memory fails.</p>

      <p>I had unknowingly begun a journey. Not across pages, but across perspectives. This book didn’t just teach me how to tell a story. It changed the way I see the world. My thoughts had evolved so much over the years, and the message of the book now, was that of unity. It showed the evils in our society and openly condemned them. That’s what the new Keshika was writing.</p>

      <p>Through the themes I’ve explored in the book, I’ve learned to question more carefully. To speak more thoughtfully. To act more consciously. I believe in the power of ideas. But I also believe in the strength of listening. I believe in ambition. But I also believe in empathy.</p>

      <p>This was never about publishing a book. It was about the person I became while writing it. I didn’t plan this journey. I didn’t even know I had started it. But I’m so glad I walked through it.</p>

      <p>Today, I’m talking about <em>The Last Enemy: One World – One Fate</em>, my first book, authored at fifteen, and how it changed me. Because as Keshika, the girl who wrote it, by the time I was done, I was no longer the same Keshika. It’s a story I thought I wrote, but somehow, it ended up writing me back.</p>

      <p>And even now, the journey hasn’t ended. Because today, the world may know this story as <em>The Last Enemy: One World – One Fate</em>, a novel that explores complex themes and ideas of how the world would survive together, or fall apart together. But for me, extremely deep down, it will always be more than a book. It will always be the story, the journey — to becoming who I am.</p>

      <p><em>And now when I look at it — Oh some journeys begin with a road, or a plan, or a decision! And then—there is this journey.</em></p>
