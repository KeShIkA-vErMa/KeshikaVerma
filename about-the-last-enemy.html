      <p><strong><a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/keshika-verma_thelastenemy-kindle-sciencefiction-activity-7315986907052531712-iuZR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEeJPoQBVAgIjoGRKcnONffl7Yq6siAqXrA"> #2 in Science Fiction on Amazon</a><br>100+ copies sold</strong></p>

      <p><em>The Last Enemy: One World - One Fate </em> is a bold and thought-provoking science fiction novel set in the year 2048, where humanity faces an uprising — not from foreign powers or alien invaders, but from its own creations: the machines it built.</p>

      <p>But this story, at its core, is not about machines. It’s about what those machines reveal.</p>

      <p>It is a mirror held up to everything we ignored — our unchecked ambition, our constant divisions, our refusal to change. Through the lens of artificial intelligence and robots, the story explores how these flaws have quietly shaped our world — and how they might become the reason it ends.</p>

      <p>For the first time, the world begins to understand what it should have always known: that we are one species. We are one world. If we don’t rise above our divisions and learn to value unity over power, we will not survive. And yes, we’ll all have the same fate.</p>

      <p><em>The Last Enemy</em> doesn’t ask questions with words. It asks them with silence, with collapse, with everything we fail to do.</p>

      <p>If you believe that fiction should do more than entertain…</p>
      <p>If you're tired of stories that shy away from uncomfortable truths…</p>
      <p>If you want a future that’s better than the one we’re walking toward…</p>
      <p><strong>Then <em>The Last Enemy</em> is the book just for you.</strong></p>

      <p>I hope this makes you question. I hope it shakes you. And I hope it reminds us all what truly matters.</p>

      <p>So go grab it, read it, and if it moves you, tell me and the world what you think.</p>
