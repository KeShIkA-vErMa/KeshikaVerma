      <h1>Light Fidelity (Li-Fi): Sending Music with Light</h1>
      <p><b>Quick note:</b> this photo was grabbed mid-setup (not a studio shot) but it shows every piece of the build clearly enough to follow along.</p>

        <figcaption style="margin-top:.5rem; font-size:.95rem; color:#777;">
          A simple Li-Fi demo: laptop → LED array (transmitter) → solar panel (receiver) → speaker.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>What you’re looking at</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>LED transmitter</b> — You can see the cluster of <b>four LEDs</b> mounted on the small transparent box near the center. The white wires inside the box carry the audio signal that makes the LEDs blink extremely fast.</li>
        <li><b>Solar-panel receiver</b> — The small solar panel propped up on a cardboard stand (left-center) faces the LEDs. It converts the changing light into a tiny electrical signal.</li>
        <li><b>Battery</b> — The 9V battery at the <b>top-right of the blue tray</b> powers the LED side of the circuit.</li>
        <li><b>Laptop (audio source)</b> — On the right edge, the laptop plays music and feeds the LED driver through the yellow/aux lead.</li>
        <li><b>Speaker (output)</b> — The black portable speaker in the <b>top-left corner</b> is the final receiver; it plays back the music that travelled through light.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How this demo works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The laptop plays a song and sends the audio waveform to the LED driver.</li>
        <li>The LEDs <b>modulate their brightness</b> at audio-rate—so fast you can’t see the flicker, but the information is there.</li>
        <li>Light hits the solar panel. Because the light intensity is changing with the music, the panel’s output voltage/current <b>changes in the same pattern</b>.</li>
        <li>That electrical signal is routed to the speaker’s input, which amplifies it, and you hear the same song—sent through a beam of light.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><i>It’s a tiny, proof-of-concept application of Li-Fi: not optimized for range or fidelity, but perfect for showing that <b>data can ride on light</b>.</i></p>

      <h2>What is Li-Fi (Light Fidelity)?</h2>
      <p>
        Li-Fi is a form of <b>visible-light communication (VLC)</b> where LEDs transmit data by varying their intensity faster than the human eye can detect. 
        A light-sensitive receiver (photodiode or solar cell) converts those changes back into electrical signals that represent data—audio in this demo, but 
        it could be text, images, or high-speed internet in more advanced systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Li-Fi can be useful</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>RF-free zones:</b> Works in places where radio is restricted or causes interference (hospitals, aircraft cabins, industrial plants).</li>
        <li><b>Security by containment:</b> Light generally doesn’t pass through walls, making it easier to confine a network to a room.</li>
        <li><b>Huge, unlicensed spectrum:</b> Visible and near-IR light bands are vast compared to crowded RF bands.</li>
        <li><b>High density:</b> Each luminaire can be its own micro-cell, reducing congestion in busy spaces.</li>
        <li><b>Energy piggy-backing:</b> Lighting infrastructure can double as data infrastructure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Trade-offs vs Wi-Fi</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Line-of-sight & coverage:</b> Light can be blocked; unlike Wi-Fi, it doesn’t go through walls. Reflections can help, but placement matters.</li>
        <li><b>Ambient light noise:</b> Sunlight and bright lamps add noise; electronics and filtering must handle it.</li>
        <li><b>Mobility/hand-off:</b> Moving between light cells needs careful design to stay seamless.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where Li-Fi can shine</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Hospitals & aircraft</b> — RF-sensitive settings for patient safety or avionics compliance.</li>
        <li><b>Factories & power plants</b> — Heavy EMI environments where radio struggles.</li>
        <li><b>Underwater links</b> — Light travels better than radio in water over short distances.</li>
        <li><b>Smart lighting & IoT</b> — Lamps that deliver both illumination and data backhaul.</li>
        <li><b>Museums, libraries, classrooms</b> — Quiet, localized data delivery tied to specific lights/spaces.</li>
        <li><b>High-density venues</b> — Stadiums, conference halls, airports with per-seat/per-zone light cells.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I built here</h2>
      <p>
        This was a minimal end-to-end Li-Fi chain—<b>music in, light out; light in, music out</b>. 
        It’s intentionally simple (LEDs + solar panel + speaker) so the concept is visible in a single photo, yet it demonstrates the core principle 
        behind far more capable Li-Fi systems.
