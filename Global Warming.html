    <h1>Global Warming: Not a Myth, But a Warning</h1>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>

    <p>Imagine a world where evidence and science are ignored in favor of conspiracy theories and denial. That world is our reality if we dismiss global warming as a manufactured crisis to control global economies. Global warming is a very real, urgent problem supported by overwhelming evidence and scientific consensus.</p>

    <p>Firstly, climate scientists do agree that global warming is more like a killer. The data is clear: rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and increased extreme weather events—and most importantly, the fact that you can not sleep with the air conditioner on at night—are observable realities.</p>

    <p>Secondly, a research conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also known as MIT, clearly states that climate change policies like carbon taxes and regulations mitigate severe impacts of climate change and global warming and ensure at least a livable future. Ignoring the realities doesn't make them disappear. And so, the idea that global warming is a tool to control economies is not appropriate.</p>

    <p>As I end this, here are a few wise words for you — “People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing, we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and it’s so sad that all you can think about is money and eternal economic growth.”</p>
