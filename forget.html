      <h1>Why Do We Forget?</h1>
      <p>We have all at least once forgotten an answer in an exam. We all tend to forget things every now and then. Why do we forget certain things so easily? What’s the answer to the unforgettable question – “Why do we forget?”?</p>
      <p>Memories are little snapshots or mental records from our experiences from the past. When we perform certain activities, those all are stored in the ‘Short term’ memory. Then, our brain makes a decision on which memories are important and which are not. Important stuff is transferred to the ‘Long term’ memory through the Hippocampus, the part of the brain that processes memories, and the rest is ditched and left in the ‘Short term’ memory. To remember something, sometimes, we do have to repeat it to ourselves a couple of times so as to not forget it!</p>
      <p>Unimportant stuff is eradicated from our brain and the information important for us is transferred to the ‘Long term’ memory, and thus, remembered longer. For example, recall a family function or your friend’s birthday party you attended last year, and now try to recall the outfit you wore a week ago. Many of us will find it challenging to recollect the latter!</p>
      <p>To improve our memory and keep our brain healthy, it’s necessary to stay physically active by exercising. Also, don’t forget to eat healthy food and, finally, give your brain a good workout session by solving puzzles and exposing it to new challenges!<br>
