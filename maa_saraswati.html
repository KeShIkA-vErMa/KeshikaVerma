      <h1>Maa Sarasvati: The Goddess of Knowledge</h1>

      <p><strong>Maa Sarasvati</strong>, the Hindu Goddess of knowledge, is the first among the holy trinity of the divine feminine. The name <em>Sarasvati</em> stems from the Sanskrit root “<em>saras</em>”, meaning “that which is fluid.” This signifies her origins as a river goddess during the ancient Vedic period.</p>

      <p>The Goddess is regarded as the patron of knowledge, poetry, literature, and music. For centuries, seekers of wisdom and learning have sought her divine blessings.</p>

      <p>She is typically portrayed as a serene woman with four arms, seated upon the <strong>Shweta Padma</strong> (white lotus), a symbol of purity and transcendence. Each of her four arms signifies a fundamental aspect of human personality: the <strong>mind, intellect, ego,</strong> and <strong>consciousness</strong>.</p>

      <p>In her hands, she carries a book (symbolizing knowledge), and a veena (highlighting her deep connection with music). Her white garments denote <strong>purity</strong> and <strong>elegance</strong>.</p>

      <p>Among Hindus, the colour <strong>yellow</strong> is considered especially dear to the Goddess. This shade represents <em>joy, ecstasy,</em> and <em>hope</em> — qualities that echo the spirit of spring. During this season, bright mustard blossoms fill the fields, and life is renewed after the cold of winter.</p>

      <p>Thus, every year between February and March, India celebrates <strong>Basant Panchami</strong> — the arrival of spring and a tribute to Maa Sarasvati. On this auspicious day, she is honoured as the embodiment of learning in all its forms: from the <strong>sciences</strong> to the <strong>arts and music</strong>.</p>

      <p>May her blessings guide us towards wisdom, creativity, and enlightenment.</p>
