        <h1>The Power of Perseverance</h1>
      <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>

      <p>We all have definitely heard about Bruhat Soma. He won 50,000 dollars in the highly competitive National Spelling Bee contest held in the USA this year. He was obviously not the most naturally gifted speller but he for sure persevered.</p>

      <p>Even JK Rowling! Everyone knows that before the first Harry Potter book was published by Bloomsbury, Rowling had faced so many rejections from publishers. Had she stopped persevering, she would not have achieved success and become the inspiration of so many budding authors like myself. If we disregard perseverance, every dream would die in the cradle itself.</p>

      <p>Perseverance, in fact, is the story of every exam aspirant. UPSC, for example, is one of the toughest exams in India. The movie, ‘12th Fail’ gives us an insight into the world of perseverance. It is the story of a person, who secured a C division in grade 12, but with perseverance and perseverance alone, he made his dreams come true and became an IPS officer by cracking UPSC.</p>

      <p>Perseverance led to genuine achievement – And the story I just told you isn’t fiction by any chance. It is the story of famous IPS Manoj Kumar Sharma from the 2005 batch of officers, and he was recently promoted to the post of Inspector General of Police in the CISF.</p>

      <p>Moving on, let me ask you this - Reaching the National Level in this competition required hard work, did it not? Preparing for both sides, writing speeches, memorizing them and practicing rebuttals with a sibling or friend isn’t just talent; it's perseverance.</p>

      <p>Plus, perseverance is never outdated, even if the world is fast-paced. One will achieve success only if they persevere and begin with a strong commitment.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, the one who perseveres achieves greatness—not through talent alone, but through unwavering determination and commitment.</p>

      <p>Thank you very much! <br>
