            <font face="Calibri"> <b>Learning how to type, then using MS Word to write simple passages like 'My best
                    friend,' then MIT Scratch, to now when I code professionally using Java Programming Language and
                    HTML. I trusted the process. With so much to remember and share with my connections, I've divided
                    the description of my school journey into three posts. The first one is about the leadership
                    positions I have held, the second about my academics and third about my extracurriculars. This is
                    Post 2.
                    I can’t remember the grades I used to get when I was a child, but I remember being a chatterbox…!
                    I was the academic topper of English, Computer Applications, Biology and Physics in grade 9, with a
                    cumulative percentage of 96.5% ICSE. I won the heritage exhibition and a laptop in the Byjus’ Win a
                    laptop challenge.
                    <br>
                    In grade 10, I got slightly diseased. But, once again, with the guidance and support of the family,
                    my brother, Alankrit Verma, my mother, Shalini Verma, and my father, Vivek Verma, I did not give up,
                    in fact, I decided to do more than I had been doing.
                    I won almost all the quizzes, Science Quest, English Quest, Computer Quest, Social Studies Quest and
                    many more. I showcased my crafting excellence by winning the Science Exhibition and Heritage
                    Exhibition. I found myself to be inclined towards one Language only (English), so, to make progress
                    in the Hindi Language, I won the Hindi Story Writing and the Hindi Essay Writing competitions. I
                    even won the GLOBAL Heartfulness Essay Event and was honoured with a Certificate of Merit (Topic -
                    "The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the Earth"). I also organsied a cultural fiesta for
                    1950+ people.
                    <br>
                    I have topped subjects including Physics and Mathematics, but I am very passionate about the English
                    Language and Computer Science. This blend of interests in Computer Science and English has not only
                    shaped my academic pursuits but also my future aspirations. It has instilled in me a unique
                    perspective, balancing technical acumen with creative expression, poised to make a meaningful impact
                    in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.
                    I am skilled in Java Programming Language, HTML, and am learning more and more. I have also created
                    a project (working model) based on Light Fidelity in Grade 9 and working model that depicted climate
                    change and its adverse impacts in grade 10.
