      <h1>Video Game Addiction</h1>
      <p>You might have heard of many terms like ‘Computer fatigue’, ‘Computer vision syndrome’, all related to ‘Video game addiction’, especially, during the pandemic. Well, if you’re one who thinks you’ve got to listen to these the most from your parents, this write-up is for you.</p>
      <p>Does it ever feel like thinking only about games? Feeling bad, irritable or moody when you can’t play? Not wanting to do other things you used to like? Lying about your screen time? Not able to concentrate on studies or whatever you long for? It’s great to do things you enjoy. But, here’s a point, can you go too far with video games? And at what point do these become an addiction?</p>
      <p>You spend a lot of time on those, indirectly wasting your time and stop thinking about your studies or education anymore, connect yourself to Wi-Fi rather than people, facilitate laziness, get yourself an indirect licence to be hurtful on losing game lives, you lose emotions and may leave no difference between killing your enemy in a game and in real life, as it has been proved in some cases. A more ridiculous drawback is you’ll gain weight, sitting for hours in the same place. You’ll not be able to stop back your gaming hobby even if you try, and being unsuccessful in life is the last thing anyone would ever wish to do!!!!</p>
      <p>Well, chill, this is not to criticize those who play. Video games are not always bad. "Games" is a topic that divides opinion—some are worried about its impact, while for a few it’s an amazing tool. If you set play timings and stick to them, can differentiate between study time and playtime, spend more time on outdoor games, play games related only to your age, have a good relationship with your parents, then, gaming is unlikely to be a problem. In addition, studies prove that if you are a good gamer, you are most likely to be a good decision-maker. Being an expert in this advanced technology is not bad and gaming has great career opportunities. Believe it or not, the international video game industry generated a whopping 99.6 billion dollars in 2016, which was more than double the revenue of the international film industry. Isn’t it amazing to know that characters in games are bigger celebrities than our movie stars? Also, when the first game was invented back in early 1970s, interestingly, within 15 minutes, every examiner on the floor started wanting to play the game. We could see those adults fighting over a video game, they say KIDS are addicted to it. But, for one who wishes to have a nice and well-dominant personality and be a big picture thinker, my best recommendation is, along with video games you play, you must also adopt in your life a crazily amazing book addiction and give equal concentration to your studies too! None, not even your parents, can stop you from playing, then. They must look no further for ways to improve you if your video game time is getting out of hand, manage yourself and be cool, as well as a lifelong PRO!<br>
