      <h1>Do Exam Results Determine a Child’s Worth?</h1>

      <p>Good morning to one and all! I am <strong>Keshika Verma</strong> and I am speaking on the topic, <em>“Do exam results determine a child’s worth?”</em></p>

      <p>Not going too far—let me talk about our results from the First Terminals. Good for some, but not so good for all, were they? But can we really say that those results dictated our future, ability, and potential? Not truly, right?</p>

      <p>Although we like to say results matter only until our neighbours and relatives are done gossiping, they’re still nightmarish for many of us. Every. Single. Time. Why are we so afraid? Why does the night before feel terrifying?</p>

      <p>It’s because we think those results define our worth. A belief I once held too. But now—and many others would agree—results don’t define a child’s value.</p>

      <p>This thought is best reflected in the story of a small boy, once asked by his teacher to take a letter home to his mother. The letter said he was incapable of learning and shouldn't return to school. That boy? He grew up to be one of the most remembered scientists of all time: <strong>Albert Einstein</strong>.</p>

      <p>Exam results simply reflect how well a student has written down memorized lessons. They don’t tell us how capable that student is in the real world.</p>

      <p>In fact, the fear of results can be so overwhelming that students study only to pass—not to learn. And that’s a loss. Much of the lesson, and the joy of it, is left unexplored.</p>

      <p>But does that mean we should cancel exams? Like a two-headed Janus, the answer is clearly <strong>no</strong>. Exams aren’t everything, but like money, they’re still important.</p>

      <p>What truly defines someone is <strong>skill, understanding, and character</strong>—not scores. And so, I leave you with a powerful quote by Albert Einstein:</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it’s worthless.”
      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
