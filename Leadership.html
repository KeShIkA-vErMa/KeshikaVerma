            <font face="Calibri"> <b> It is all about the journey and our past experiences shape our future. I have just
                    ended a chapter of my life and am about to start another. Let me share my Leadership positions I have help so far, with you. 
                    <br>
                    I have always been very ambitious. The first fruit I got for my dedication in the form a leadership
                    position in the school Cabinet was Class Monitor in grade 5 üöÄ. Now I find it insignificant but it
                    was a great deal that time. My parents thought that I brought unimaginable pride to the family. I
                    loved that!. That motivated me to such an extent that I won myself 5 gold medals and 2 silver medals
                    that year in English declamation, Hindi declamation, dance, singing, story writing, and whatnot!,
                    along with rank 3 in the class. In grade 6, things improved even more!
                    <br>
                    In grade 7 and 8, the lock down hit. But...that did not stop me. I worked hard.
                    I was the Secretary of English Literary Club in grade 8, the Deputy Head Girl of the School in grade
                    9 and finally the Head Girl in Grade 10! I organised a number of events, led a great team of people
                    to carry the legacy of one of the best schools in the state forward. It has definitely prepared me
                    for leadership roles in the future! Thanks a lot to my bro Alankrit Verma, for all the guidance he
                    has given to me.
                    <br>
                    I hosted a number of events, of which a Cultural Fiesta for 1950+ people stands out. I got to
                    interact with my city's IAS, IPS, and IFS officers and earned a lot of recognition. I am fond of my
                    heritage and culture and was interviewed by the media on the day of the Heritage Exhibition of my
                    school in Kullu. I am a volunteer at the Red Cross Society and am dedicated to community service.
                    <br>
                    I sometimes try to recall my past great experiences, which overwhelm me and bring tears of gratitude
                    for the journey I am on.

                    <br>
                    ‚ÄúThe woods are lovely, dark and deep,
                    But I have promises to keep,
                    And miles to go before I sleep,
                    And miles to go before I sleep.‚Äù
                    <br>
                    These lines from my favourite poem - ‚ÄúStopping by the woods on a Snowy Evening‚Äù by Robert Frost,
                    encourage me to persevere and remain dedicated to my responsibilities, knowing that there is still
                    much more to accomplish on this path of leadership and progress.!
                    <br>
                    I am happy to tell you that I have moved to Chandigarh for my education (PCM) in the best school in
                    the city - Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School! My new journey has started!
