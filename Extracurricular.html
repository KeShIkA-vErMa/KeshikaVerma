            <font face="Calibri"> <b> As a child, I remember spending hours a day, practising just one dance move,
                    practising for a month just in order to win a dance competition at school, which I now find of
                    little significance. Memories of Dance Competitions, singing competitions, fancy dress competitions,
                    Declamation Competitions and thousand other things are stretched in my mind for time immemorial.
                    <br>
                    With so much to remember and share with my connections, I've divided the description of my school
                    journey into three posts. The first one is about the leadership positions I have held, the second of
                    my academics and third about my extracurriculars. This is Post 3.
                    <br>
                    In class 5, I remember winning myself 5 gold medals and 2 silver medals in English declamation,
                    Hindi declamation, dance, singing, story writing, and whatnot!, along with rank 3 in the class. I
                    was not less than an all rounder and it got even better in grade 6!
                    <br>
                    In grade 7 and 8, the lock down hit. But...that did not stop me. I kept working hard.
                    <br>
                    In grade 8, I got my first significant out of school achievement, which blew my mind and my family's
                    mind! 3rd in North India was a big deal! How? - I participated in the ASISC Father Hess Memorial
                    Literary events (grade 8) for the Declamation Category and won myself a gold medal at the state
                    level, receiving a golden opportunity to represent my state (Himachal Pradesh) in the northern
                    region of India. I won third rank in North India.
                    <br>
                    I did the same in grade 9, with first rank in the state and went to St. Stephen's School Chandigarh
                    for the Regional competition. I got to interact with so many people having similar interests and
                    future plans, which was a lot of fun. In grade 10, I won the silver medal at state level and I found
                    myself to be lucky to interact and share thoughts with the people at Sacred Heart Sr. Sec. School,
                    Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh.
                    <br>
                    Because of the unwavering guidance and support I received from my bro Alankrit Verma, I started
                    participating in more competitions.
                    I was a part of the school's girls' football team in grade 9. I have a proven track record in
                    English, winning all the Competitions, and winning a laptop in the Byjus' Win a Laptop challenge!! I
                    love making rangoli and coordinated a team to make a rangoli based on space research on Children's
                    day!
                    <br>
                    I even brought out the actor in me. I participated in the English skit, which presented the Merchant
                    of Venice play by Sir. William Shakespeare; I got the role of the main character, Portia, because of
                    my eloquence in English and unexpected talent in acting. I organised a cultural fiesta for a
                    gathering of 1950+ people. I even won the title of 'Miss OLS' in the farewell function. For my
                    Eloquence, Leadership Skills and Wisdom, I was titled 'Miss Future President' by my juniors at
                    school.
                    <br> <br>
                    Lastly, of course, I believe - “If you can speak, you can influence. If you can influence, you can
                    change lives”.
                    I have just won the AIR 6 in the national debate by bal education trust
                    Also, I am interning as an Outreach Coordinator at Unsway and Content writer at Saarthi.
