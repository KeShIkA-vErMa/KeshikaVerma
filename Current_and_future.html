        <h2> Future aspirations </h2>
    </center>
    <center>I have topped subjects including Physics and Mathematics, but I am very passionate about the English
        Language and Computer Science. This blend of interests in Computer Science and English has not only shaped my
        academic pursuits but also my future aspirations. It has instilled in me a unique perspective, balancing
        technical acumen with creative expression, poised to make a meaningful impact in an increasingly digital and
        interconnected world.
        <br>
        I am a very confident individual. I never leave any opportunities that come my way, have a growth mindset, and
        maintain a positive attitude towards life.
