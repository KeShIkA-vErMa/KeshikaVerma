      <h1>What Is Fear and Why Is It Such a Crippling Emotion?</h1>

      <p>If you search the meaning of <strong>‘Fear’</strong> in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, it is defined as <em>“an unpleasant, often strong emotion caused by anticipation of danger.”</em> In other words, our fear is always about what’s going to happen next. That means fear is about something that does not exist. So why do our blood pressure and heart rate increase over something completely <strong>non-existent</strong>—something imaginary?</p>

      <p>Fear is a product of a hallucinatory mind. Negative thoughts and imagination are the roots of fear. We fear because we are rooted not in reality, but in our mind—constantly chewing on the past and projecting it into the future. If we are rooted in reality, <strong>there is no fear</strong>.</p>

      <p>Yes, we can plan our future—but we cannot <em>live</em> in our future. Yet when we fear, we try to live in the future. Ironically, even the future will only come to us in the form of the <strong>present</strong>.</p>

      <p>The only way to overcome fear is to return to the present—respond to what is here <em>right now</em>. Stop imagining what doesn’t exist, and suddenly, there’s no space for fear to survive.</p>
