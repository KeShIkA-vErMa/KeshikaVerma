    <p><strong>After months of planning and refining, Digital Disha officially came to life! </strong></p></div>
    <p>I was born and raised in Kullu, a small town nestled in the Himalayas, where access to computers and digital education was rare. And so, it has always been one of my goals to make computer education accessible to everyone, no matter where they live. <br> <br>
      I founded Digital Disha, a student-led initiative to promote digital literacy across rural Himachal Pradesh. <br><br>
      This launch film documents Cohort 1 (June 2025) at Government High School, Kotli, a remote village in the lower Himalayas, where 24 students (Classes 9 and 10) used a computer for the first time. Over a few days, they learned how to use a number of tools.<br><br>
      Also, the goal is not just to teach tools to the students, but to provide them with a direction by encouraging them to explore technology themselves too. I am proud to have achieved this goal through the first cohort of the program. (<i>Disha</i> means “direction” in Hindi.) <br> <br>
      Digital Disha began as a promise to my community and to many other communities like mine where computer education seems like a far fetched dream. The first cohort has since sparked local conversations, earned support from educators (including an LoR from Headmaster Mr. Nihal Singh) and recognition from leaders like Dr. Kiran Bedi (First Woman IPS Officer and Former Lt. Governor of Puducherry). <br> <br>
