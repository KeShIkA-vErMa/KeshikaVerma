    <p><strong>After months of planning and refining, Digital Disha officially came to life!   </strong></p>   </div>
 
      <p>I was born and raised in Kullu, a small town nestled in the Himalayas, where access to computers and digital education was rare. With limited computer classes at school, I taught myself how to use a computer, explore the internet, and eventually code, learning everything I could on my father’s old PC.<br> <br>

That experience shaped my belief that technology should not be a privilege—it should be accessible to everyone, no matter where they’re born. To help bridge that gap, I founded Digital Disha, a student-led initiative to promote digital literacy across rural Himachal Pradesh. <br><br>
This launch film documents Cohort 1 (June 2025) at Government High School, Kotli—a remote village in the lower Himalayas—where 24 students (Classes 9–10) used a computer for the first time. Over a few days, they learned MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Canva, and built a simple website with HTML/CSS. We kept it hands-on and paced so that everyone could succeed. After class, I shared resources so they could keep learning on their own—several students messaged me days later with updates on their progress. That’s the goal: not just skills, but direction. (Disha means “direction” in Hindi.) <br> <br>

Digital Disha began as a promise to my community. It has since sparked local conversations, earned support from educators (including an LoR from Headmaster Mr. Nihal Singh) and recognition from leaders like Dr. Kiran Bedi. For me, teaching in that Himalayan classroom was healing—and proof that access changes lives. I’m pursuing computer science to build tools and systems that scale this impact for my community and beyond. <br><br>
