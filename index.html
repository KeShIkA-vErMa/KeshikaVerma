        <h1> About Keshika Verma</h1>
        Hello there! I am Keshika, a 15-year-old highly motivated and versatile individual.

        ☆ Education - I am a student at Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School, Chandigarh since April, 2024 (Joined
        for grade 11 and 12). I did my High school from Our Lady of the Snows School in Kullu, Himachal Pradesh, a
        place where my journey began.
        <br>
        ☆ Leadership - I was the Secretary of the English Literary Club in grade 8, leading to positions of greater
        responsibility, including Deputy Head Girl in Grade 9 and ultimately Head Girl in grade 10, distinguishing
        myself among my peers. In grade 11, I have become the Disaster Management Incharge on my Current school. I
        was also the chief editor of the school magazine for 2 years.
        <br>
        ☆ Honourable mentions in Competitions - I have a proven track record in public speaking, securing 1st place
        in the Zonal Level ASISC Fr. Hess Memorial Declamation contest three times consecutively and achieving Rank
        3 in North India. I have also won the Debate Competition organised by Bal Education Trust
        (www.baleducationtrust.in) - All India Rank 6. My proficiency in English extends beyond that, evidenced by
        winning a laptop in Byju's Win a Laptop challenge and being honored with a Certificate of Merit in the
        GLOBAL Heartfulness Essay writing event, 2023 (Topic - "The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the
        Earth").
        <br>
        ☆ Public speaking - I have hosted a number of events, of which a Cultural Fiesta for 1950+ people stands
        out. I got to interact with my city's IAS, IPS, and IRS officers and earned a lot of recognition. I am fond
        of my Heritage and Culture and was interviewed by the local media on the day of the Heritage Exhibiton of my
        School. I am a volunteer at the Red Cross Society and am dedicated to community service and social
        responsibility.
        <br>
        ☆ Interships - The LinkedIn Manager for QUEST, The Content Writer at QUEST, Project Head at QUEST, Outreach
        Coodinator at Unsway, Creative Content writer at QUEST
        <br>
        ☆ Academics - I was the High School topper (96.4% ICSE), for which I recieved a cash prize of Rs. 1500 from
        my school. I am skilled in the Java and HTML Languages. I am very passionate about the English Language and
        Computer Science. This blend of interests in Computer Science and English has not only shaped my academic
        pursuits but also my future aspirations. I have a personal website which you csn find in the projects
        section.
        <br>
