  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    <div class="about-section">
      <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Keshika Verma</strong>, a 16-year-old who loves to code, write and build things that matter. I am the founder of the Digital Disha Program, a digital literacy program run in the Himalayan belt of India, and the founder of Keyzen, a product that is revolutionizing how everyone learns to type. I recently published my first book, <em>The Last Enemy : One World - One Fate</em>, and that journey shaped how I think, write, and create.</p>
    
      <p>I’ve explored ideas through assistive tech projects like <strong>OptiPulse</strong> and <strong>WaveSync</strong>, wrote a <strong>research paper</strong> on Automation of Spillway Gates of Dams and created a model on <strong>Climate change and Deforestation</strong> to raise awareness in my community. I’ve led as <strong>Head Girl</strong>, now serve as <strong>Discipline Executive</strong> and <strong> Finance Head at Interact Club (Rotary Sponsored Club)</strong>, and was a <strong>Peer Educator</strong> under the <strong>Ministry of Education’s Adolescent Peer Educators Leadership Program</strong>.</p>
    
      <p>I organized <strong>SHSMUN</strong>, one of North India’s largest student conferences, and supported the global growth of <strong>GenAI Genesis</strong>,
      <a href="https://genaigenesis.ca" target="_blank">genaigenesis.ca</a> especially from India. I also volunteer with the <strong>National Service Scheme (NSS)</strong> and the <strong>Red Cross Society</strong>, and was honored with the <strong>NEON Dhairya Award For Overall Excellence. </strong> I also won <strong>All India Rank 6</strong> in the <strong>National Debate Competition by Bal Education Trust</strong>.</p>
    
      <p>Whether it’s public speaking, writing, or building, I’m all about exploring, creating, and growing.</p>
