      <h1>Head Girl’s Message</h1>
      <blockquote>
        “The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
        But I have promises to keep,<br>
        And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
        And miles to go before I sleep.”
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>- Robert Frost</strong></p>
      <p>These lines from my favourite poem <em>“Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening”</em> by Robert Frost encourage me to persevere and remain dedicated to my responsibilities, knowing that there is still much more to accomplish on this path of leadership and progress. Becoming the head girl has instilled a sense of immense gratitude for the trust bestowed upon me, and with happiness brimming in every step of progress I take, I am determined to make a lasting impact and inspire others.</p>
      <p>With this guiding principle and poetic inspiration, I have consistently achieved the personal goals I set my heart on, and I am more determined than ever to apply the same unwavering dedication to the growth and betterment of my institution. To embrace this responsibility, I am driven by the conviction that our dreams, backed and fuelled by determination and commitment, have the power to shape the future where our institution thrives and flourishes.</p>
      <p>As the head girl of our distinguished institution, I find profound wisdom in the notion that true leadership is not all about seeking personal glory, but rather, it is about nurturing and empowering others to reach their fullest potential.</p>
      <p>As a leader, I strive to embody the attributes of leadership, including confidence, critical thinking, decision-making, integrity, resilience, and effective communication. With the guidance of my esteemed teachers, I aim to create a positive environment where collaboration and support thrive, nurturing both personal growth and the advancement of our institution.</p>
      <p>Through transparent communication and teamwork, I, with the other members of the student council, shall stimulate a culture of trust and mutual respect. As the head of the student cabinet, my vision and that of the student council is rooted in the belief that nurturing individual talents and fostering a culture of continuous learning will lead to collective achievements.</p>
      <p><strong>Leading with purpose; embracing confidence and a growth mindset!</strong> <br>
