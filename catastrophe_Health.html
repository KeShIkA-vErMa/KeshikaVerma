      <h1>The Unconscious Catastrophe of Health</h1>

      <blockquote>
        “Intelligence and skill can only function at the peak of their capacity when the body is healthy and strong.” — John F. Kennedy
      </blockquote>

      <p>This quote portrays a profound message—health and fitness are curative not just at the grassroots level, but even at the topmost ranks. Why? As the Greek philosopher Thales said, <strong>“A sound mind in a sound body.”</strong> This illustrates the harmony between physical and mental health.</p>

      <p>Let’s start at the grassroots. Reading and writing involve mental strain—and, of course, fatigue and anxiety can sometimes become unbearable. The mind hungers for relief, and the body craves energy. Regular participation in outdoor games offers exactly that: a fit body and a refreshed mind. Inclusion of games in education and workplaces should no longer be optional—it’s a necessity. The phrase “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” shouldn’t just exist in essay competitions; it needs to be practiced on real fields.</p>

      <p>Everyone acknowledges the importance of relaxation, yet society often places it at the bottom of the priority list. Why?</p>

      <p>Sports today are more than just games—they are viable career options. They shape interests, build character, develop skills, foster healthy competition, and boost confidence. Even a short daily engagement in sports can shield one from diseases like arthritis, obesity, heart problems, and diabetes.</p>

      <p>Excelling in sports not only promotes health but uplifts a student’s profile, helping them outshine others. Because <strong>sports inspire us to compete—and to thrive</strong>.</p>
