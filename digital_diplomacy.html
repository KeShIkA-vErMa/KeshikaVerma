      <h1>Digital Diplomacy: A Global Game Changer</h1>

      <p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>

      <p>Imagine a world where a single message, sent from the remote reaches of the Arctic, can echo almost instantly in the halls of power across continents. That’s the power of <strong>digital diplomacy</strong>.</p>

      <p>Hi everyone! I’m Keshika Verma and I'm here to affirm that digital diplomacy is indeed a <strong>game changer</strong>.</p>

      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on his ambassadors to “remain ahead of the curve on digital diplomacy.” That’s the reason no one can forget India’s powerful <strong>Vaccine Maitri Initiative</strong>, which reached countries across the globe.</p>

      <p>In a recent war crisis, <strong>Ukraine</strong> used social media and delivered <strong>virtual addresses</strong> to the United Nations to garner worldwide support — all digitally.</p>

      <p>Some might worry that digital diplomacy is insecure. However, digital security has become stronger than ever, enabling faster and more inclusive global conversations.</p>

      <p>Digitalization allows nations to communicate effectively, which is <strong>crucial for tackling global issues like climate change</strong>. Even right now, we’re all connected digitally and conducting highly intellectual discussions — that itself speaks volumes.</p>

      <p>As I conclude, I say that heroes like <strong>Maya Angelou</strong>, <strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong>, and thousands of others must be proud. Thanks to digital diplomacy, every nation can now tell its own story to the world.</p>

      <p>Thanks for giving me your ears — digitally.</p>

      <p>- KESHIKA VERMA</p>
