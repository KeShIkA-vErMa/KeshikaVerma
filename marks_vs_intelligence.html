      <h1>Do Marks Determine Intelligence?</h1>

        <h2>🔵 FOR the Motion: Marks Determine Intelligence</h2>
        <p>If marks didn’t determine intelligence, Harvard and MIT would admit students through a lucky draw — not based on SAT scores, AP scores, school results, academic extracurriculars, or college credits.</p>

        <p>Sure, marks don’t show if you can paint like Picasso or sing like Lata Mangeshkar. But when it comes to academics, marks do show who is ready.</p>

        <p>Marks are an objective way to measure learning. Without them, how would we ever know who should build our bridges, design our spacecraft, or perform life-saving surgeries?</p>

        <p>While not perfect, marks are a valid and structured way to measure academic intelligence.</p>

        <p>In competitive fields like engineering, medicine, and civil services, marks reveal how deeply and efficiently students understand complex concepts under time pressure.</p>

        <p>They say, “Don’t judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree.” Well, if it’s a swimming test, the fish that swims fastest should get the highest marks. Academics work the same way — the person with the most learning gets the highest marks, and that person often earns the best college seat or internship.</p>

        <p>Marks reflect not just intelligence, but also discipline, focus, perseverance, and readiness to meet high standards.</p>

        <h2>🔴 AGAINST the Motion: Marks Do NOT Determine Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Well… who are we kidding? Marks, practically, do not determine intelligence.</p>

        <p>This thought is inspired by a well-known story — of a boy who almost failed high school and later became one of the greatest scientists of all time. Who are we talking about? Sir Albert Einstein.</p>

        <p>Exam results only tell us how well students can write down what they’ve memorized. But real intelligence is not just that.</p>

        <p>The best poets and artists never scored 100 in grammar tests. Thankfully, creativity doesn’t need a report card.</p>

        <p>Now imagine this: you’re a very intelligent student. But one night before the exam, your goldfish dies. Or you’re mentally or physically unwell. Will you score well? Probably not. But does that make you unintelligent? Definitely not.</p>

        <p>Now flip the coin. Let’s say you’re not very intelligent. But one night before the exam, fear kicks in. You cram every word and vomit it onto the paper the next day. You might get good marks. But does that mean you’re truly intelligent? I really doubt it.</p>

        <p>And so, we understand — marks and intelligence are not the same. They are not comparable.</p>
