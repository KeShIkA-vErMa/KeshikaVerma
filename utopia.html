      <h1>Utopia</h1>
      <blockquote>“…where the rich do not exploit the poor, society has no blind faith, and it does not believe in useless wars.”</blockquote>
      <p><strong>- Thomas More</strong></p>
      <p>Sounds imaginary, right? In fact, Utopia was a book written by Thomas More, describing an imaginary, perfect island in America during the Renaissance period in Europe. Since then, Utopia has been a term used for a place where people are happy and everything is just perfect. Now, everyone has their own reason to call a place a ‘Utopia’. Some might think of the amazing shopping malls of the USA while others might think of the perfect greenery and beauty of Switzerland or Sweden. But do you think that is all that matters? When I was introduced to this term in my history book, I stopped to think about India and why, even after independence, it is still not a utopia for all.</p>
      <p>The first thing to mention here is corruption and greediness. Ranging from top officers and employers to many other workers around you, are corrupt and always ready to grab as much as they can. It is hard to believe that according to a study, more than 62% of the people in India have first-hand experience of paying bribes! These things are so common even in daily life that we see people full of expertise and the highest degrees are rejected jobs but those who are rich but with a piece of trash are considered as priceless as a Kohinoor.</p>
      <p>Next, is equality. Don’t think it is as easy to have as it is to say. Illiterate people are mostly unaware of their rights and face discrimination in many spheres of life. Right to education, employment, Right against exploitation, and freedom of religion are other rights that are often violated. Our rights, as students, are Right to information and Freedom of speech and expression, which the student writers of this magazine experience directly but do you ever stop to wonder of the children who are labouring in the fields? Is it even a fault of theirs?</p>
      <p>India has once again topped the chart in poverty, with 22.8 crore population sitting hungry and at a huge lack of just enough to survive and ‘stay happy’.</p>
      <p>Is there any way India can be called a Utopia? The answer is ‘no’, but it is ‘no’ only as of now.</p>
      <blockquote>“People who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world are the ones who really do.”</blockquote>
      <p>Humans have progressed so much in the past years. Inventions that we call great today were once a part of the inventors’ wild imagination. Now, dear readers, I’ll ask you, if ‘Utopia’ is an ‘invisible’, ‘imaginary’, ‘ideal’ concept, why is it not possible for us to make it real?</p>
      <p>What can’t we do together? Where can’t we reach together?<br>
