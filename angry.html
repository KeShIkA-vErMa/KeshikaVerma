      <h1>Why Do We Get Angry?</h1>
      <p>Anger is a complex emotion we all struggle to deal with. Have you ever felt so angry that you felt like screaming or throwing things away just because something didn’t go your way? Maybe your sibling ate your share of chocolate, your friend didn’t return the book they took from you, or the last season of your favourite series didn’t live up to your expectations.</p>
      <p>Imagine yourself walking on the street, amazingly dressed for your friend’s birthday party, when a car swiftly cuts you off and splashes mud on your dress, which ultimately turns you from a peace-loving creature into an incredible Hulk! Changes begin to happen in your body – Amygdala, a part of your brain releases chemicals that prepare you for some crazy physical activity. Also, hormones like Adrenaline are released into the body, which cause your heartbeat to increase.</p>
      <p>Very fortunately, another part of our brain called the Prefrontal Cortex, responsible for making judgments, also gets activated, thus, making sure that we don’t react illogically.</p>
      <p>Constant chronic anger can significantly increase our chances of getting heart diseases like high blood pressure, heart attack, or even a stroke. Although, it’s completely okay to get mad at times, we must always keep our emotions in check and adopt a healthy lifestyle. If we prefer discussing our anger with some adult, like a teacher or parent, it usually goes away…! To completely prevent anger, one must practice meditation and breathing exercises regularly.<br>
