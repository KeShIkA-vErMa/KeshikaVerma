      <h1>Happiness in School</h1>

      <p>Happiness is a difficult thing to measure—but not impossible to notice. As a student, I don’t usually feel it in big, dramatic moments. More often, it sneaks in through smaller things—a group activity that finally works well, a class that runs smoothly, or just a day that doesn’t feel rushed.</p>

      <p>In physics, we learn Newton’s First Law: “An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.” And honestly, happiness can work the same way. We go on with the same routine until something shifts—a shared laugh, a kind word, or a little success—and suddenly, the day feels lighter. That small moment acts as a force, setting happiness in motion.</p>

      <p>There’s also something called potential energy—the energy that’s stored until it’s ready to move. I see that in class too. A student with an idea who finally gains the confidence to speak up—that shift from hesitation to action carries a kind of happiness that’s calm, steady, and real.</p>

      <p>And then there’s equilibrium—when all forces balance out. In school, happiness can come from that balance: between study and rest, seriousness and fun, effort and ease. Some days feel like everything just fits together. That balance is its own kind of joy.</p>

      <p>So, happiness at school isn’t loud. It’s not about being perfect or always achieving something huge. It’s in the quiet confidence that grows with support, in feeling seen and understood, and in those little victories that push us forward.</p>

      <p>We don’t have to chase happiness. Sometimes, we just need to recognize it—in the motion, in the effort, and in the moments that make us feel whole.</p>
