      <h1>The Universe + Biology = ?</h1>
      <p>Biology is the study of life, as we’ve been told millions of times, and almost 40% of students love it.! But what comes to our mind when we hear “Universe”? – Black space, a picture of the solar system, the asteroid belt, moon, the earth and much more. “The Universe” in itself is an enthralling term. It has forced mankind from ages and ages to research about it – From Aristotle to almost every second person in today’s world wants to know about the “Universe”.</p>
      <p>Space research is often very interesting to many, while it is completely boring to some others since it has no direct bearing on most people's lives. But actually, it does relate to everyone!</p>
      <p>We are life on this earth. But wonder how it all began? – Science or God? How did life in the universe evolve? If talking about career, what if we like both biology and astronomy- what subject should we choose? Here it comes! – Astrobiology!</p>
      <p>Astrobiology, formerly known as exobiology, is an interdisciplinary scientific field that studies the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. Astrobiology considers the question of whether extra-terrestrial life exists, and if it does, how humans can detect it. Sounds interesting! How cool it might be to study life beyond earth, stars, planets, galaxies, and everything in between!</p>
      <p>But still, field of Astrobiology is very new in India. Not many education centres offer education in “Universe + Biology”. However, the career opportunities in this field and numerous – even NASA has one separate program!</p>
      <p>So, Universe + Biology = A very interesting field known as Astrobiology.<br>
