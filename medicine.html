      <h1>Medicine Dispenser</h1>
      <p> One of my earliest ideas (Class 8). <br> <br> There are so many ailments in this world. Medicines to cure or reduce the effect of these ailments come in plastic bottles and wraps. Plastic is non - biodegradable. Now, if plastics are said to be ‘recyclable’, it’s hard to collect bits of plastic, like that of medicines, so recycling it all is a far-fetched dream and so it gets buried, affecting humans, indirectly. Medicines sold in the present system are even costlier than they should be. So, I realised the need for something simpler and more helpful.
My project, a medicine dispenser, attends to this problem. As per my idea, a medicine dispenser, somehow easily made moisture free, shall be installed in pharmacy shops. When in need, a person may fill capsules in a small glass box easily available at his place. When again in need, the person may refill the same box once again from the nearby pharmacy shops. Even if we feel like we should ignore the dispenser thing, yet reduce the use of plastic, we can not conclude that all medicines should be manufactured in glass bottles. If we plan to do so, we’ll be wasting a lot. For medicines like those for hypertension, hypothyroidism and others which are regularly used, we can use just one dispenser for many people lifelong rather than hundreds of bottles. Seeing the population that intakes such fast selling medicines, we’ll be saving nearly 30 million bottles in 2 months in one shot for each such medicine! It is best suited for generic medicines. This even makes medicines cheaper for the public. Dispensers can be easily installed in hospitals for poor patients. We even completely finish the use of plastics and aluminium in certain areas of the pharmaceutical department.
