      <h1>Recommendations</h1>
      <p> 1. <b>Bhawna Khatri </b> (<a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhawnakhatri/">Bhawna's LinkedIn</a>) <br>
        August 16, 2024, Bhawna reported directly to Keshika<br>
        "I’ve had the pleasure of working closely with Keshika at Unsway, where she serves as the Assistant Director of the Coding Club. In my role as a curriculum designer under her supervision, I've been very impressed by her leadership skills and her ability to make complex concepts easy to understand. Keshika is not just a leader but a mentor who genuinely cares about the growth and development of her team. Her friendly nature makes it easy to ask questions and seek guidance, and her patience and clear explanations have been invaluably helpful for me. I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn from her and would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a supportive and knowledgeable leader." <br> <br> <br>

        2. <b>Mann Vats</b> (<a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/mannvats27/">Mann's LinkedIn</a>)<br>
        May 4, 2025, Mann managed Keshika directly <br>
        "it’s been an absolute pleasure working with keshika at unsway. she began as an outreach coordinator in the coding club and, through quiet consistency and genuine merit, rose to become the assistant director and eventually the director—becoming the second girl director in the entire organization. what truly sets keshika apart is her sense of responsibility. whenever someone above her is unavailable, she steps in without hesitation, handles everything smoothly, and never once complains. she’s someone you can count on to manage things single-handedly, and she does it with calm and clarity. she’s also a brilliant articulator, clear, thoughtful, and effective in the way she communicates. two major tasks were pulled off effortlessly under her leadership, and it’s this steady, no-fuss dedication that makes her such an asset.
        i genuinely recommend keshika for any role that values ownership, communication, and quiet leadership."<br> <br> <br>
